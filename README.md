<h3>Overview</h3>
Who doesn't love Disney villains?! Click on the button that has your favorite Disney villain's name on it. By doing so, you'll see 10 giphy images of them. By clicking the image, it'll change the state of it from animated to still. Don't see your favorite Disney villain? Use the search bar to type their name in. As a result, your search result will render as a dynamically created button amongst the others.

<h3>Components</h3>
HTML | JavaScript | Giphy API

<h3>Additional Commentary</h3>
I noticed if the Disney villain isn't as "popular," the Giphy images won't exclusively be of them. Also, maybe it's an issue with my laptop, but I have to press the image really hard in order to get the image to pause.

<h3>Problems with Initial Submission</h3>
Wasn't able to successfully pull from the API. This code has come a long way.

<h3>TO-DO LIST</h3>
Style the page more with some CSS.
